# USB HID Controlled LED System (Archive)

**Stack:** C • Embedded Systems (USB Host HID)  

**Summary:**  
Firmware project using a USB mouse/keyboard to control LED outputs on an embedded board.  
- Mouse movement moved LED positions.  
- Mouse button clicks changed LED colors.  
- Keyboard inputs toggled board LEDs.  

**What I learned:**  
- How to parse USB HID reports and track device state.  
- Mapping hardware inputs to user-visible outputs.  
- Debugging and working with USB host drivers.  

**Note:** Only the lab PDF write-up is included here — code was run on lab hardware and is not available.
